# vendor_wingtech_wt88047

Volte was gone when blobs moved from system/bin to system/vendor/bin

but now i reverted those blobs to system/bin and now volte is working fine ( with proper blobs from jalebi device)

Actully i do not know what happened with our device IMS blobs 
i have built a rom using wingtech vendor blobs and IMS was gone but only after replacing vendor blobs from jalebi now volte is working fine
